This if my first professional portfolio.

## Description

This is my very first portfolio that I built from scratch. You get the chance to know a little about myself, projects i've done, and how to contact me. You also get a look a chance to see how far i've come since my first project! I will be updating this portfolio as I continue to expand my knowledge with HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript!
